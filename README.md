# automaton

python script to execute bash command based on changes in size of a file.

**download automaton.py**

**put it in directory where you are working**

**to execute run**

   * python3 automaton.py "./main.c" "gcc ./main.c && ./a.out"
   * python3 automaton.py "./index.js" "node ./index.js"
   * sky is the limit with what you can do with this
   
**now everytime you make changes to main.c it will compile and run automatically**

**ideally one would split screen into two parts and keep this running in one part**
